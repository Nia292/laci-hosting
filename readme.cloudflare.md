# Cloudflare

Right now, Cloudflare is only available as compile-from-source in the [Main Repo](https://github.com/LaciSynchroni/server/tree/main/Docker).
The compiling is done for you, and ultimately, this deployment is not much more complex than pre-built deployments. 

If you wish to use Cloudflare, please follow the [instructions outlined in this readme](https://github.com/LaciSynchroni/server/blob/main/Docker/Readme.md).
